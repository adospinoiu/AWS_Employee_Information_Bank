# Initial Set-Up of GitHub & VS-Code
#1 Created the repository on GitHub webpage

#2 Linked the GitHub-repo to my local environment on my computer. There is a 'main' folder of Projects on my local computer. Git-Bashed into Projects-Folder then Git-Cloned with the link provided from GitHub webpage where the repository was created.

# Created the Front-End & Back-End Folders
#1 On the front-end created the REACT APP with the installation line "npx create-react-app aws_employee_information_bank-front-end". The last part of the installation line is actually the name of the folder that will be created where the React Install files will be.

#2 Install 'npm-init' to install Node.js on the back-end. Ensure the "entry point" is indicated as 'server.js' in the prompts during installation 

#3 In the package.json file ensure you add the 'scripts' of "start": "node server.js" and to the main section add "type": "module" to be able to use ES6 notation.

#4 Make sure there is a .gitignore file of the back-end as well. (Copy it from the front end).

#5 Install Express on the back-end

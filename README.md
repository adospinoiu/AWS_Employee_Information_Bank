# AWS_Employee_Information_Bank
AWS_Employee_Information_Bank


Initial Set-Up of GitHub & VS-Code
#1 Created the repository on GitHub webpage
#2 Linked the GitHub-repo to my local environment on my computer. There is a 'main' folder of Projects on my local computer. Git-Bashed into Projects-Folder then Git-Cloned with the link provided from GitHub webpage where the repository was created.

Created the Front-End & Back-End Files
#1 On the front-end created the REACT APP with the installation line "npx create-react-app aws_employee_information_bank-front-end". The last part of the installation line is actually the name of the folder that will be created where the React Install files will be.
